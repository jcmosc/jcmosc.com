# First post

Hello and welcome to my site!

I taught myself how to program largely by reading online tutorials and other developers' blogs.
Eventually I was lucky enough to be employed as an iOS engineer, and from there my career grew.
I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for all the people who came before me and wrote about their experiences developing software.
So it is only natural that I contribute my own writings back to the web.
Better late than never!

Most of these posts will be related to iOS development since that is the first platform where I got serious (unless you count Macromedia Flash ðŸ˜›).
I am no longer an engineer though iOS still has a special place in my heart and remains my main passion outside of my current day job as a product manager.

Recently I have been working on an iPad app, which I am tentitavely calling ShapeUp.
It will allow anyone to create professionally-designed flow chart diagrams without having to be good at design themselves.
This past year or so I have gone down a rabbit hole of refactoring the codebase from using `UICollectionView` to something that can only be described as a total reimplementation of SwiftUI.
_Do not do this._
It is not worth it and I am just now coming up for air.
As a product manager I should know better than to embark on giant refactor projects without a clear timeframe and goal.
But the great thing about hobby projects is you don't need to think about business value.

Now that I have done it I have a lot more insights about how the internals of SwiftUI is built.
Hopefully I can organise everything I've learnt into a coherent series of postsâ€¦
